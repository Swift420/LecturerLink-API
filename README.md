# Lecturer Management API
The problem centers on developing a Restful API for effectively managing staff, their offices, and
allocated courses within the Faculty of Computing and Informatics. These offices can
accommodate multiple lecturers. A lecturer is characterized by essential attributes, including a
staff number, office number, staff name, title, and a list of the courses they are teaching.
Additionally, a course is characterized by specific details such as the course name, course code,
and NQF (National Qualifications Framework) leve

The API has the following functionalities:
-  Add a new lecturer
-  Retrieve a list of all lecturers within the faculty.
-  Update an existing lecturer's information.
-  Retrieve the details of a specific lecturer by their staff number.
-  Delete a lecturer's record by their staff number.
-  Retrieve all the lecturers that teach a certain course.
-  Retrieve all the lecturers that sit in the same office.

Note that the staff number should serve as a unique identifier for a lecturer
